6.11 Info dictionary

A document's trailer may contain a reference to an Info dictionary that
provides information about the document. This optional dictionary may contain
one or more keys, whose values should be strings. These strings may be
displayed in an Acrobat viewer's Document Info dialog. The characters in these
strings are encoded using the predefined encoding PDFDocEncoding, described in
Appendix C.
Note Omit any key in the Info dictionary for which a value is not known, rather
than including it with an empty string as its value.
